# Boid Simulation 
*playable boid simulation - homework project for university course*

Welcome to the Boid Simulation project! This is a playable simulation of boids created using Python and Pyglet, developed as a project for a university programming course. The code is an early work in my programming journey and may need refactoring and fixing, but the game is fully functional and offers some fun.

## Features
- Simulation of boid behaviors such as alignment, cohesion, and separation.
- Interactive controls to manipulate boids and gameplay elements.
- Playable player boid with shooting capabilities.
## Controls

- N: Add a new boid at the center of the window.
- M: Remove the last boid from the simulation.
- SPACE: Toggle drawing of primitives.
- A: Apply/Ignore the collision handling rule.
- S: Apply/Ignore the alignment rule.
- D: Apply/Ignore the navigation towards the center rule.
- F: Apply/Ignore the hunting player rule (if the player boid exists).
- P: Create a playable player boid at the center of the window.
- T: Shoot from the player boid (if created)

## To Do
- Refactor and clean up the code for better readability and efficiency.
- Implement additional boid behaviors.
- Enhance the graphical representation of boids and environment.
- Add more interactive features and controls.
